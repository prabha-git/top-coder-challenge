"""
Micro-Tuned Hybrid Model Solution: Optimized with minimal parameter adjustments.

This model achieves the best balance by keeping all proven business rules
while making tiny adjustments to reduce over-predictions on high-error cases.

Key business rules implemented:
1. 5-day trip bonuses (Lisa: "5-day trips almost always get a bonus")
2. Slightly reduced efficiency bonuses at 180-220 mi/day (Kevin's insight, micro-tuned)
3. Tiered mileage with diminishing returns (Lisa: "First 100 miles get full rate, after that it drops")
4. Receipt sweet spot bonuses for $600-800 (Lisa: "$600-800 seem to get really good treatment")
5. Enhanced high receipt penalties (Lisa/Marcus observations, micro-tuned)
6. Micro-tuned interaction bonuses (Kevin's "sweet spot combo")
7. Short trip premium for 1-2 day trips (data analysis insight)
